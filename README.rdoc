== README

This is the second Rails app I've done, the first was in Rails Girls South FL, this one was at Ancient City
Ruby in St. Augustine. Both were done with lots of guidance.

I will add a link when I find it to the tutorial this app is from.

What I ought to learn for next time is to use more descriptive commit messages than "add all the things" XD
